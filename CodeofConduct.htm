  <section class="m-section">
    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This code of conduct governs the environment of the Altered Eco 
Server. It was created not because I anticipate bad behavior, but because 
I believe that articulating our values provides us with clear avenues 
to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course.</p>

  </section>

  <section class="m-section">
    <h2 id="Values">Values</h2>
    <p>We want the server to be fun for all members. This means all admins 
	must have integrity and respect for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>We believe Eco is a game designed for collaboration with others</strong>. Therefore 
Altered Eco is committed to creating a equal playground for all players.</p>

<p><strong>Cheating is strongly discouraged</strong> and any use of admin power that gives
advantage over other players is considered cheating.</p>

<p><strong>We strongly believe in creating a peaceful environment</strong>. Discrimination,
toxicity and disrespect is not tolorated.</p>

<p><strong>Altered Eco is committed to providing a welcoming and safe 
environment</strong> for people of all races, gender identities, gender 
expressions, sexual orientations, physical abilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, 
life experiences, nationalities, ages, religions and beliefs.</p>

  </section>

  <section class="m-section">
    <h2 id="Expected behaviors">Expected behaviors</h2>
    <p>Every admin is expected to follow the values of the server, be 
considerate to others on the server, and contribute to a 
collaborative, positive, and healthy environment in which we can all 
have fun.</p>

<p><img src="Code%20of%20Conduct_files/face.png" alt="" class="right"></p>

<p><strong>Be supportive to players</strong>, both proactively 
and responsively. Offer to help if you see someone struggling or 
otherwise in need of assistance (taking care not to be patronizing or 
disrespectful). If someone approaches you looking for help, be generous 
with your time; If you are unable to help, direct them to someone else 
who may be of assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Be generous and kind in both giving and accepting critique</strong>.
 Critiques are an important part of improving ourselves and the server. Good critiques
 are kind, respectful, clear, and constructive, focused on goals and 
requirements rather than personal preferences. You are expected to give 
and receive criticism with grace.</p>

<p><strong>Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication</strong>, 
especially text communication, where opportunities for 
misunderstanding are greater. Tone is hard to decipher online; make 
judicious use of emoji to aid in communication. Use the voice
channels when it makes sense as it benefits from social cues 
that may go missing in text communication.</p>

<p><strong>Be humane</strong>, All situations should be addressed with kindness and understanding. 
Warnings should always be issued before disciplinary action is taken and all discipline should be fair
and just.</p>

    <h2 id="Addressing a problem">Addressing a problem</h2>
    <p><img src="Code%20of%20Conduct_files/bubbles.jpg" alt="" class="wide"></p>

<p>When theres misconduct or harassment, there are a number of 
things you can do to address the situation. Depending on your comfort 
level and the severity of the situation, here are some things you can do
 to address it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Address it directly.</strong> If youâ€™re comfortable 
bringing up the incident with the person who instigated it, contact them 
directly to discuss the situation. Be sure to approach these 
conversations in a forgiving and understanding spirit. Players may act in defense during confrontation. 
De-esculation is the best course of action followed by discipline: an angry or tense conversation will
not do anyone any good. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Talk to another admin.</strong> Another admin may have personal experience on which to draw 
that could be of use to you. Reach out and discuss the situation with them. They may be 
able to advise on how they would handle it, or help you handle it directly, of course, is that you should also be 
available when other admins reach out to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Talk to the server owner.</strong> the server owner knows
	a lot about the dynamics of the server, which makes them a 
good person to look to for advice. They may also be able to talk 
directly to the person in question if you feel uncomfortable doing so yourself.</p>
  </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Keep a track record.</strong> Always make a log in the admin section of discord any time you use your admin powers or handle a issue, Be sure to leave a vague description of the problem and action taken to resolve it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

  </section>

  <section class="m-section">
    <h2 id="Corruption & Conflict of Interest">Corruption & Conflict of Interest</h2>
    <p>Abuse of power hurts the server as a whole and is a major violation of the code of conduct. Admins are expected
to play with due regards to the server's level playing field. If you're a witness to something that seems like it isnâ€™t aligned with our values or seems detrimental to the server, reach out to the person who has violated the code of conduct or the server owner directly to voice your concerns.</p>

  </section>

  <section class="m-section">
    <h2 id="Committing to improvement">Committing to improvement</h2>
    <p>None of us are perfect: Itâ€™s expected that all
 of us will from time to time fail to 
live up to our high standards. What matters isnâ€™t having a perfect 
track record, but owning up to your mistakes and making a clear and 
persistent effort to improve. If you are approached as having 
(consciously or otherwise) acted in a way that might be agianst
the code of conduct, refrain from being defensive; remember that 
if someone calls you out, it likely took a great deal of courage for 
them to do so. The best way to respect that courage is to acknowledge 
your mistake, apologize, and move onâ€”with a renewed commitment to do 
better.</p>

<p>That said, repeated or severe violations of the code of conduct can and will be
 addressed by the server owner, and can lead to disciplinary 
actions, including termination.</p>

  </section>

  <section class="m-section">
    <h2 id="Contributing">Contributing</h2>
    <p>Members of the Altered Eco team are invited to contribute to this
 code of conduct as well as the development of the server in one of two ways: either by raising a
 concern or sharing feedback. If you have a question or suggestion for evolving the policies or direction of the server,
contact Altered Minds outlining your suggestion.</p>

<p>Team members should follow changes to the server as well as policy and are invited to 
contribute to discussions around changes. Note, of course, that 
contributions to the code and discussions around it are themselves 
governed by the rules of the code.</p>

<p>All changes and suggestions will be vetted by the server owner.</p>

    <h2 id="Faq"><center>Commonly asked Questions</center></h2><br><br>

    <p><strong>Q: What should i do if someone wants to reset a skill?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Check to see if the skill was taken by accident. Also, make sure they are still level 1 of that skill.</p>

  </section>

  <section class="m-section">
   <p><strong>Q: In what situations should i use fly and teleport?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Fly and teleport are reserved only for urgent situations. ex, someone needs help and they are far or require immediate attention!</p>

  </section>

  <section class="m-section">
   <p><strong>Q: What constitutes bannable behavior?</strong></p>
    <p>A: If a player repeatedly breaks the rules after being warned multiple times or acts in egregious behaviour then they may recieve either a temporary ban or permanent ban, depending on the severity. Players will only be permanently banned after a majority vote by admins.</p>

  </section>
  
  <section class="m-section">
   <p><strong>Q: Are there any commands that should never be used?</strong></p>
    <p>A: <em>'Wand'</em> should only be used for setting up the server. <em>'Give'</em> should only be used for admin purposes. ex, fix an issue or spawn land claims needed for government projects. <em>'Dev Tool'</em> should also only be used for admin purposes as well. <em>'Prehistoric' should never be used ever! Only to be used before the start of a season by the server owner.</em>There are exceptions to these rules though, if in doubt just check with the server owner.</p>
